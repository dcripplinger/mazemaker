I made this on a whim to help me construct a 3d maze in Dragon Quest Builders.
It was my first time trying to programmatically generate a maze. It mostly
worked, but unfortunately it left a few spots in the maze disconnected, so I had
to tweak it in the game to make it solveable. I tried doing Wilson's algorithm,
but maybe I got something wrong in it.

The file maze1.txt serves as an example of what the program outputs, although
I made a couple small edits manually to the file after it was generated. The file
is basically instructions of what blocks to lay down for each layer.

I don't intend to improve on this, so I'm just throwing it into my personal
github account to gather dust.
